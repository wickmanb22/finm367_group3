    "### 1. Conceptual Issues for LTCM\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Describe LTCM's investment strategy wrt to securities traded, trading frequency, skewness (many small wins or a few big hits?), and forecasting (what is behind their selection of trades?).\n",
    "\n",
    "LTCM primarily engaged in convergence and relative value trades with government bonds, low default risk corporate bonds and swaps, foreign currencies, and long-expiry options. The firm traded alot, with 100 different strategies and 7600 open positions during 1997, with medium-term investment horizon; convergence trades required time to reach equilibrium. LTCM sought to exploit small inefficiences through the use of leverage and cost-effective financing, typically resulting in many small wins, but also hit a few big wins. Trading opportunities were identified through security mispricings, statistical modelling, and forecasting market participant's liquidity needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are LTCM's biggest advantages over its competitors?\n",
    "\n",
    "LTCM was the valuation of novel financial instruments, the use of complex self-financing trades, and access to great financing options including a $700 million unsecured credit line and low haircuts as dealers competed for LTCM's business.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Briefly discuss LTCM's four types of fund risk (collateral haircuts, repo maturity, equity redemption, and loan access).\n",
    "\n",
    "During periods of market stress, dealers increased collateral haircuts, which required LTCM to post more assets in a bad state of the world. I don't think this forced LTCM to liquidate positions early though, because LTCM used so little of its working capital due to financing trades through repo markets. Dealers were also hesitant to rollover short-term repo market agreements in bad states of the world, potentially restricting LTCM's financing ability. Equity redemption is the risk that investors might withdraw capital during periods of poor performance, although LTCM imposed a capital lock-up requirement of three years and allowed outflows on a staggered schedule. Lastly, as LTCM's positions deteriorated, financial institutions closed previously existing lines of credit and restricted loan access, further hampering LTCM's ability to meet collateral requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. LTCM is largely in the business of selling liquidity and volatility. Describe how LTCM accounts for liquidity risk in their quantitative measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "LTCM measures risk using the probability distribution of potential profits and losses like VaR, rare event stress testing and measuring the correlation of profits. LTCM accounts for liquidity risk by estimating how price movements can impact haircuts, or the cost of financing positions during periods of severe stress. This led to a schedule of potential worst-case liquidity demands over time, which helped LTCM to avoid forced liquidation of convergence positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Is leverage risk currently a concern for LTCM?\n",
    "\n",
    "No, LTCM was 'only' leveraged 19:1 during the case study, although after returning $2.7 billion to investors (without reducing the scale of its investments) in 1997, the fund's leverage correspondingly returned to its historic high of 30:1.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the risk of convergence trades, where LTCM relies on converging spreads (if spreads converge, they make money or if it diverges, the trade becomes more attractive as convergence is still expected at a future data)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary risk of convergence trades for LTCM was that the cost of financing could become too high, potentially forcing the fund to liquidate its positions before the expected price convergence could be achieved, resulting in significant losses. This risk was exacerbated by LTCM's high leverage and reliance on short-term financing, which made the fund vulnerable to margin calls and creditor demands during periods of market stress."

    "2. Report the skewness, kurtosis, and (historic) VaR(.05)\n",
    "3. Comment on how these stats compare to SPY and other assets we have seen. How much do they differ between gross and net?\n",
    "\n",
    "LTCM's gross returns are significantly better (7% more average return per year, higher Sharpe ratio) than SPY during this period. The downside risk, as measured by excess kurtosis, VaR, and max drawdown, shows that LTCM and SPY have similar risk profiles, although note that SPY was well-behaved (nearly monotonically increasing) during this period. The net returns, gross returns less fees, are more aligned with the market."
